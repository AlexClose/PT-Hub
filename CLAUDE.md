# PT-Hub Coaching App — Context & Status

## Project Overview
Single-file SPA at `/home/user/PT-Hub/index.html` (~7640 lines) for a personal training coaching platform. Two portals:
- **Coaching Portal** (`#coach-*`): Coach manages clients, logs sessions, views dashboards
- **Client Portal** (`#client-*`): Clients log workouts, view training programs

## Tech Stack
- Vanilla JS, no framework
- Supabase for backend (REST API via `sb()` function, keys hardcoded in file)
- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS
- Deployed to Vercel via GitHub — **pushes to `main` go live automatically**
- GitHub repo: `alexclose/pt-hub`

## Git Workflow (IMPORTANT)

Push directly to `main` — no feature branches, no PRs (solo project):

```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Message"
git push -u origin main
```

## Current Commit State

**Current HEAD** `dbf48af`: found and fixed the vanishing-supersets bug's *real* trigger for Tim specifically — his stored exercise names use a legacy "SS1 Name" (bare space, no colon) tag format that every colon-requiring regex in the app silently failed to recognize (see "Session log" below and the "RESOLVED" section for full detail). The earlier same-session fix (`cf00676`, superset-unaware drag-reorder + `removeEx()`) was a real, separate bug and is still correct/needed — it just wasn't what was actually hitting Tim. Everything ships straight to `main` → Vercel. **Standing instruction from the user this session: push every fix/addition to `main` immediately, no holding changes on a review branch — the user checks on their phone as we go and will say if something needs reverting.**
**File**: `index.html`, ~9700 lines (line numbers shift constantly — ALWAYS grep, never trust the numbers in this doc)

## Generate Next Program: supersets not surviving generation — RESOLVED (was "⚠️ OPEN ISSUE")

**Original symptom:** generating a program for client "Tim" produced **zero supersets in any workout** — every exercise came out as a standalone row, even ones the user expected to be paired. Six earlier fixes in the prior session (lead-exercise flip-flop, back-region matching, over-aggressive keep-rate, unifying the generate-preview's editor with the real one, and fixing "superset of one" display) were all correct and are NOT being re-litigated here — see git history around `f34b19e`..`5441677` if ever needed.

**Actual root cause, found by code audit + an offline repro (not just the "check Tim's data" diagnostic step the prior session left as next-step):** the program-day editor's **drag-reorder** (`setupExDrag`) moved individual `.edit-ex-row` elements with zero awareness of superset grouping. Dragging just ONE member of a superset pair to a different spot in the list silently separated it from its partner in `editingExercises`/stored `structured_program`, while **both rows kept the same `.ss`/`SSn:` group tag** — same-tag-but-non-adjacent, a form of corruption invisible until something tried to group by that tag. `removeEx()` (deleting one exercise) had the identical failure class: no cleanup of the surviving partner's tag.

This is exactly what produced the "zero supersets" symptom, and why the normal editor and Generate Next Program could disagree on the *same* stored data:
- `_genOrderDay` (generator) grouped strictly by **adjacency** → saw the split pair as two orphaned singles → the (correct, previously-shipped) solo-demotion logic dropped both to plain exercises.
- `_parseExForEdit` (normal editor) grouped by raw **tag count**, not adjacency → behaved differently on the identical data, which is why the two paths never told a consistent story.

**Fix shipped (commit `cf00676`), verified offline against three scenarios — a scattered-but-real pair, a genuinely orphaned solo tag, and a normal well-formed pair — all behave correctly:**
1. **`_coalesceSsGroups(exs)`** (new) — regroups same-tag exercises back to adjacent regardless of how they ended up ordered in storage, so a pairing that got scattered is *rescued* instead of dropped. Both `_genOrderDay` and `_parseExForEdit` now call it first, so they can never diverge on the same input again.
2. **`setupExDrag` rewritten to be superset-aware.** Two modes based on which handle is grabbed: the superset header's own handle (new — `.ex-drag-handle-group`, added to the wrapper's "⊕ Superset" bar) moves the **whole group** as one block among other top-level blocks/exercises; a row's own handle, when that row lives *inside* a superset wrapper, now only reorders members **within** that same group — it can no longer escape and desync from its partner. Standalone rows behave exactly as before (unaffected).
3. **`removeEx(i)`** now demotes an orphaned partner immediately when a deletion leaves it alone in its group, instead of leaving a stale tag for something else to trip over later (this closes the exact gap the prior session flagged as a follow-up).

**Why this was missed before:** the prior session's diagnostic plan assumed the corruption (if any) was pre-existing in Tim's stored data from an old `removeEx()` call, and the next step was "ask the user to check the normal editor." The actual mechanism turned out to be reproducible in the app **today**, on fresh data, via ordinary drag-reordering in the program editor — a much more common coach action than deleting a superset member. No live-data check was needed to find or fix this; it was fully diagnosable and testable offline (see below).

**⚠️ This fix alone did NOT resolve Tim's symptom** — the user re-tested and still got zero supersets on every regenerate. A screenshot of Tim's day in the normal editor revealed the *actual* trigger: his exercise names are literally `"SS1 Lat Pulldown"`, `"SS2 Chest Fly"`, etc — **a bare space, not the `"SS1: Name"` colon-space format** every current save path (`_encodeEx`) writes and every read site's regex required. This is clearly data from an older version of the app, before the colon convention existed. Because the regex demanded a colon, it silently failed to recognize or strip the tag *anywhere* — not just in Generate: superset grouping in the normal editor, PR detection, `exercise_logs` writes, muscle-mapping input, autocomplete fill, and the session-detail viewer all treated these rows as plain exercises with a literal `"SS1 "` stuck in the visible name (exactly what the screenshot showed — six individually-bordered gray rows, no orange superset wrapper).

**Second fix, commit `dbf48af`:** introduced one shared `_SS_TAG_RE=/^SS(\d+)\s*:?\s*/i` (colon optional) and replaced all ~30 call sites across the file that previously used a colon-requiring pattern. `_buildGenProgram` additionally now rebuilds the tag in the canonical `"SS<n>: "` form on every generate pass (rather than preserving whatever separator the source data used), so a legacy-format program self-heals to the modern format the moment it's regenerated. Verified offline against Tim's *exact* data shape from the screenshot (SS1/SS2/SS3, three pairs, no colons) — both the generator and the normal editor now recognize all three pairs with clean display names.

**Residual, low-priority note:** any of Tim's *historical* `exercise_logs` rows that were written while this bug was live may have `"SS1 "`-polluted `exercise_name` values baked in permanently (those aren't retroactively cleaned — this only fixes read/write behavior going forward). Not worth a data migration unless it actually surfaces as a visible problem (e.g., in PR history or the muscle heatmap for old dates).

**Not yet independently confirmed:** the user has not yet re-tested Tim's actual program on their phone since the second fix shipped. If it's still not resolved, get a fresh screenshot of both the normal editor and a new Generate attempt.

> **Standing rule (user instruction):** Shared features like the **custom-workout sheet** must be updated for **BOTH** the coaching portal and the client portal in the **same state**, unless the user says otherwise. When something is clearly a shared feature, update both sides in one pass and call it out — don't ask each time.

> **Workflow habits this project expects:** syntax-check every edit (`node` extract script blocks → `new Function`) before commit; commit+push to `main` immediately after each verified change; update this file's Session log after each shipped item; the user tests on their iPhone (PWA, `viewport-fit=cover` — mind `env(safe-area-inset-*)` on anything fixed to screen edges).

## Visual System (established this session — do not regress)
- **Ambient particle canvas** `#ambient-bg` (see session log "Ambient v2/v3/v4"): fixed, z:0, `main` is z:1 above it. NEVER put it at negative z-index (iOS culls it behind composited scrollers).
- **Cards are near-transparent glass**: `rgba(16,22,29,0.22)` + hairline border (`--border2`), NO backdrop blur (blur smears the 2px motes invisible). Applies to `.card`/`.stat-card`/`.client-card`, dashboard stat tiles, Today ring card, Clients-grid rows (`rgba(23,29,38,0.2)`). Modals/sheets/inputs stay OPAQUE for readability.
- **Design tokens**: neutral hairline borders (`--border`/`--border2` rgba(148,180,220,…)), surfaces `#10161d/#171d26/#1d242f`, accent #4fa3e8/#2563eb, success #43d9a2, Syne (display) + Instrument Sans (body).
- **Signature elements**: Today gradient ring (blue→green, `#todayRingGrad`); per-client avatar = dark glassy tile + hue glint + colored initials (`_clientHue` golden-angle by join order, `_avatarStyle(c,size)`); top radial glow per view; bottom light source + rising motes.
- **Native feel**: no tap-highlight, `touch-action:manipulation`, `button:active` scale, `div[onclick]:active` dim (hover:none), stagger `_staggerIn` on first render only, stat count-up once (`_statsAnimated`).
- **Emoji policy**: none in persistent chrome (SVG/text instead); "moment" emoji OK (⚡ CTAs, 🏆 PBs, Crushed-it screen).

### Session log (most recent work — newest first)
- ✅ **Dashboard visual split: Insights vs Learn Today module identities** (`9147195`). User: the two cards were identical gray glass boxes — the whole pre-clients stack blurred together and was easy to scroll past. **Coaching Insights** = purple utility module (purple left accent edge + tinted border + 26px stroke-SVG bulb icon tile + Syne card title, replacing the 9px gray uppercase label). **Learn Today** = editorial card tinted by the DAY'S category color (diagonal gradient wash `col16→glass`, colored left edge/border, book SVG tile, 17px Syne title, pill-style "Read more" button) — rotates look daily with the topic's category, so it can never twin with Insights. Rhythm: 14px between modules, 26px break before Clients. Also replaced the 💡/📚 emoji that had crept into persistent chrome with stroke SVGs (per the established emoji policy). **If the user says the dashboard still feels crowded**, next candidates: collapse multiple alerts into one summarized strip, or make Insights collapsed-by-default with a one-line teaser.
- ✅ **Continuing Education v2 — 60 advanced topics, deep detail pages, true no-repeat rotation** (`6b64ac5`). User feedback on v1: detail pages too shallow ("one paragraph isn't enough to actually use it with clients"), library too small ("never want repeats"), content too basic ("most people already know the basic stuff"). Three changes: (1) **`_CE_LIBRARY` expanded 24→60** and leveled up — VBT/velocity-loss, cluster sets, PAPE, isometrics, eccentric overload, lengthened-position training, BFR, regional hypertrophy, attentional focus, muscle memory/myonuclei, failure nuance, maintenance doses, anabolic resistance, creatine/caffeine/alcohol, CWI-blunts-hypertrophy timing, HRV, overreaching, bracing/IAP, ankle dorsiflexion, GLP-1 clients, menopause, youth myths, tendinopathy loading, pain science, cycle-syncing evidence-check, etc. Same integrity line as v1: honest generic attributions, emerging literature hedged as such, zero fabricated studies/statistics. (2) **Detail schema upgraded**: `body` is now an ARRAY of paragraphs (avg ~930 chars) + new `practice` array rendered as a color-coded "In Practice" bullets card in `showCEDetail` (renderer is backward-compatible with string bodies). (3) **No-repeat rotation**: `_ceTodayEntry` rewritten from calendar-modulo to a persisted shuffled cycle (`bm_ce_cycle` {order,pos,day} + `_ceShuffle`) — advances one topic per calendar day, guarantees every topic exactly once per cycle, reshuffles at cycle end with a consecutive-day-repeat guard, absorbs library additions mid-cycle (new ids join the current cycle's remainder). Verified offline: 3 simulated 60-day cycles → full coverage each, zero consecutive repeats, stable within a day. **Content library was authored via a Python builder script (see scratchpad pattern `ce_build.py`) that json-escapes and splices the JS block — reuse that approach for future library expansions.** Live-research-feed idea remains future work (needs a real vetted source; the app is a static SPA and can't self-update content).
- ✅ **Continuing Education — daily "Learn Today" card + browsable library** (`b3e469f`), coach portal. User's requested feature: busy coaches stop learning once they're running a business and CE credits become a grind, so surface one evidence-based tidbit a day on the dashboard they already open constantly. Placement decision (via AskUserQuestion): **homepage card → full-screen sheet, NO new tab** (keeps the 5-tab bar). Content decision: **I wrote an honest starter library** (`_CE_LIBRARY`, 24 entries across 7 color-coded categories in `_CE_CATS`) — accurate, mainstream sports-science guidance with honest attributions to genuinely established bodies (NSCA/ACSM/ISSN positions, well-documented research lines like Schoenfeld volume/rep-range work), **deliberately NOT fabricated studies/citations put in real orgs' mouths** (I flagged this integrity line to the user explicitly; a real citation-verified feed can replace/augment `_CE_LIBRARY` later). Pieces: `_ceHomeCardHtml()` card injected into new `#dashEducation` container (in `renderDashboard`, below Coaching Insights); `openCELibrary()` full-screen sheet (featured Today card + Saved section + collapsible categories reusing the `.muscle-group` pattern); `showCEDetail(id)` detail page (chip/title/hook/body/source + Save toggle) which auto-calls `_ceMarkReviewed(id)`. Storage: `bm_ce_saved` (bookmark ids), `bm_ce_reviewed` (keyed `YYYY-M`→[ids], dedup) → drives the "N reviewed this month" counter. Daily rotation is deterministic (`_ceTodayEntry`, `Date.now()/86400000 % len`; divisor→43200000 for twice-daily). Disclaimer on every surface. **Deferred per user:** the "Apply it" per-tidbit action (concrete client to-do) — noted for a later pass, as is a v2 idea of tying tidbits to the coach's own data (e.g., pair a movement-variety tidbit with a Coaching-Insights over-use flag). Verified content integrity (all fields present, no dup ids, no double-quotes, valid categories) + save/reviewed logic offline. **Not yet checked on the user's phone.**
- ✅ **Program-builder consistency audit** (`7c20e22`). User asked to confirm the program-building experience is identical across all entry points. Verified: exactly THREE functions open the shared `editProgramModal` — `openEditProgramDay` (edit a live client's day), `editBuildDayExercises` (build new program / template), `editGenDayExercises` (Generate Next Program preview) — and all three go through the same `renderEditExerciseList()`, so the editor body (add exercise, ⊕ superset, ⊕ combine-existing, superset-aware drag, thumbnails, autocomplete, 💡 suggestion chip, Protocol "Ideas"), the `_ensureLibraryHas` library-feed, the `_encodeEx` superset encoding, the `Edit — <day>` title, and the `_exExitPairState()` reset are all shared. `saveProgramDay` branches only on `_editProgSaveMode` ('build'/'gen'/normal) for WHERE the encoded day lands — no UI divergence. **One real bug found + fixed:** `editBuildDayExercises` never set `editingClientId`, so the suggestion chip in the build flow used whichever client was edited last (stale) instead of the client being built for; now sets `editingClientId=buildingClientId` (null for templates, handled). The DOM-order LOGGING builders (client custom-workout sheet, coach ad-hoc log) are a separate system (not structured-program building) and were out of scope for this pass.
- ✅ **Generate Next Program — mechanic-appropriate rep schemes + more cross-regenerate variety** (`9316a68`). Two user complaints. (1) **Rep schemes didn't fit the movement** — a face pull was being suggested `3x3`, a strength scheme no one uses on an accessory. `_PRESC_VARIETY` (one fixed pool, mechanic-blind) was split into `_PRESC_VARIETY_COMPOUND` (5x5, 4x6, 12-10-8-6 pyramid, tempo, wave — heavy low-rep) and `_PRESC_VARIETY_ISO` (3x12, 3x15, 4x12, rest-pause, dropset, back-off — hypertrophy range); `_prescSuggestionFor` now picks the pool via `_exMechanic(name)`, so isolation/accessory work stays in higher reps. Drives BOTH the generator and the program-builder's 💡-suggestion chip. (2) **Same exercises recurred on every Regenerate** — each pass re-drew from the same top-scored candidates with no memory. Added `window._genRecent`, a rolling FIFO avoid-set (~last 2 passes, capped 80) reset per client in `generateNextProgram` and seeded into the swap's `used` map in `_buildGenProgram`, so consecutive Regenerate taps rotate through fresh picks; the existing two-stage ignore-`used` fallback means it only ADDS variety, never starves a pool into a "kept". Also widened the accessory pick window in `_altExerciseFor` (top 8→12); lead slot stays top-6 so the main lift remains a recognizable compound. Verified the scheme split offline (face pull → `3x12 rest-pause`; squat/bench → pyramids/tempo). **Deferred (noted, low priority):** occasional genuinely-obscure dataset exercises still slip through — user says it's minor since they hand-edit anyway; not worth aggressive blind scoring changes without the dataset loaded in-tool to test against.
- ✅ **Generate Next Program — keep-across-programs behavior REMOVED, swaps everything now** (`44433f1`). The compound-only keep from `0d2653c` (just below) still felt like it "kept a lot," and the user decided keeping exercises wasn't the workflow they wanted anyway. `_buildGenProgram` now swaps **every** exercise — no more `swapChance`/mechanic gating. Key fix for the "still keeping a lot" symptom: a swap used to silently fall back to KEEPING whenever `_altExerciseFor` returned null, which happens routinely once the cross-day `used` set exhausts a muscle group's pool late in a big program. Now it's a two-stage call — `_altExerciseFor(clean,used,isLead)||_altExerciseFor(clean,{},isLead)` — so if the used-restricted pool is empty it retries ignoring `used` (a cross-day repeat beats keeping the original). An exercise is only kept when it can't be matched to the dataset at all (shown honestly as "no fresh variation found"). To keep a specific lift, the coach leaves it out of the swap by hand-editing the preview. If the user ever wants *some* keep behavior back, previous approaches are in git history (`0d2653c` compound-gated, `e90759c`..earlier position-gated).
- ✅ **Generate Next Program — keep-behavior re-gated to compounds only** (`0d2653c`) [SUPERSEDED by `44433f1` above — kept for history]. User feedback: the generator kept "too much" — at least ~2 exercises per workout, often random accessories they then had to hand-replace. Old logic gated by list position (lead slot ~60% kept) + a blanket 25% keep on everything else. New logic in `_buildGenProgram` gates by **mechanic**: `isCompound=_exMechanic(clean)==='compound'` → `swapChance=isCompound?0.3:1`. So compound anchor lifts (squat/bench/deadlift/row/press) are ~70% kept (occasional swap for variety), and isolation/accessory work **always attempts a swap** (kept only when the dataset genuinely has no alternative left — an honest "no fresh variation found"). Rep/set scheme still rotates on kept lifts (`_prescSuggestionFor`, unchanged). The dials are one-liners if the user wants to go further: `swapChance=isCompound?0:1` = never swap the big lift; drop the `isCompound?0.3` toward `1` = swap everything. Verified the compound/isolation split offline against a realistic mixed day (works through the legacy "SS1 " no-colon tag too).
- ✅ **"Combine two exercises into a superset" — new action in the program-day editor** (`531fdd1`). The existing "⊕ Superset" button (adds two blank paired slots) was kept as-is (user: "works well"); this adds the complement they asked for — grouping exercises that are *already* in the day as standalone rows. A "⊕ Combine two exercises into a superset" link (`_renderPairTrigger`, rendered into `#exPairTrigger` below the list) appears whenever the day has ≥2 standalone exercises. Tapping it enters a lightweight **pair mode** (`window._exPairMode`/`_exPairSel`): each standalone `.edit-ex-row` shows a tappable select circle (`.ex-pair-check`; superset-member rows aren't selectable), and a `.pair-mode-bar` at the top of the list shows the running count + Combine/Cancel. `_exCombineSelected()` assigns the picked rows a fresh `_nextSsGroup()` id and splices them contiguous, anchored at the first selection, so they render in one orange wrapper. Drag-reorder is disabled while pairing (`setupExDrag` bails on `_exPairMode`; handles hidden via `#editExerciseList.pairing .ex-drag-handle`); any add/remove or reopening the editor calls `_exExitPairState()` so stale indices can't be acted on. Lives in the shared editor, so it's available in normal edit, build-new-program, AND the generate-preview edit. Combine/reorder logic verified offline (adjacent, scattered, three-way, already-grouped-selection cases).
- ✅ **Generate Next Program — vanishing supersets, RESOLVED (took two fixes).** See the "Generate Next Program: supersets not surviving generation — RESOLVED" section near the top of this doc for full detail. **Fix 1** (`cf00676`): the program editor's drag-reorder (`setupExDrag`) and `removeEx()` were unaware of superset grouping — either could separate a paired exercise from its partner while both kept the same group tag, corrupting `structured_program`; the generator's adjacency-based grouping then correctly demoted these corrupted pairs, which looked like "zero supersets." Fixed with `_coalesceSsGroups()` (rescues scattered-but-real pairs) + a superset-aware drag-reorder + a self-healing `removeEx()`. **This was a real bug but didn't fix Tim** — user re-tested, still zero. A screenshot of Tim's day in the normal editor revealed the actual trigger: his exercise names are literally `"SS1 Lat Pulldown"` etc — a bare-space legacy tag format (pre-dates the `"SS1: Name"` colon convention every current save path writes) that every colon-requiring regex in the app silently failed to recognize, not just in Generate. **Fix 2** (`dbf48af`): introduced a shared `_SS_TAG_RE` (colon optional) and swapped it into ~30 call sites across the file (grouping, PR detection, `exercise_logs` writes, muscle mapping, autocomplete, session viewer); `_buildGenProgram` now also normalizes the tag to the canonical colon form on every generate pass, self-healing legacy data as it's used. Verified offline against Tim's exact data shape from the screenshot. **Still not independently confirmed on the user's phone as of this write-up** — the two-fixes-in-one-session history here is a reminder that a *plausible, real* root cause (fix 1) isn't necessarily *the* root cause for a specific user report; get an actual data sample (screenshot, or raw JSON) before declaring victory next time this class of bug comes up.
- ✅ **Coaching Insights (dashboard) + Protocol Library (program builder + Library tab) — new coach-facing feature pair**, built to solve a problem the user described directly: "I get stuck in the same patterns... doing the same exercises and rep schemes with everybody... I have the knowledge in my head but don't reach for it in the day-to-day." Two parts: (1) **Coaching Insights** (`computeCoachInsights()` — grep it): cross-client pattern detection on the dashboard, tappable → `openCoachInsightsDetail()` full detail view with actual client names + real alternative-exercise suggestions (reuses `_altExerciseFor`, the same swap logic Generate Next Program uses). Flags an exercise overused across ≥50% of active programs, rep-scheme homogeneity (≥70% straight 8-12 reps), and programs running 6+ weeks unchanged. Deliberately conservative — needs ≥3 active programs before saying anything, never guesses at signals the data can't support. (2) **Protocol Library** (`_PROTOCOL_LIBRARY` array + `openProtocolPicker()`): 17 set/rep schemes beyond straight sets (5x5, pyramids, wave loading, clusters, myo-reps, rest-pause, DUP, contrast/PAP, density blocks, EMOM, circuits, deload week, 1RM testing, isometric holds), grouped into 5 color-coded collapsible categories (Strength/Hypertrophy/Power/Conditioning/Recovery & Testing) matching the exercise-library's own collapsible-group visual pattern. Accessible standalone (Library tab) and contextually (💡 Ideas button per exercise row in the program builder, applies directly to that row). **Smart defaults layer on top** (`_prescSuggestionFor(clientId,name)`): every "+ Add Exercise" used to hardcode `prescription:'3x10'` as the seed value — found and fixed at the source (now seeds empty) so a dashed "💡 Suggested: X — tap to use" chip can appear instead, deliberately excluding whatever scheme that client's `exercise_history` shows they did last time. Same helper now also drives Generate Next Program's rep-scheme rotation. An inline (non-popup) day-completeness nudge (`_dayGapNudge()`) flags missing core work once a day has 3+ exercises, using the existing muscle mapping. **Explicitly deferred to a future session per user request:** a "continuing education" feature (surfacing current training/nutrition research to counter coaches calcifying on decades-old methods) — noted, not built.
- ✅ **Data safety: evaluated, built, then intentionally removed a DIY backup layer.** User was on Supabase free tier (zero automatic backups) — flagged as the most urgent item in the whole session given "I run my entire business through this." Built a Vercel Cron → `/api/backup` → dated JSON commits to a `backups/` folder in this repo (with `scripts/restore-backup.js` + a plain-English `BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md`), explicitly 404'd `/backups/*` in `vercel.json` so client data (names/sessions/weights) couldn't be scraped as public static files. User then upgraded to Supabase Pro (real automatic backups + point-in-time recovery) and, on reflection, decided the DIY layer's ongoing setup/maintenance cost wasn't worth it as a second layer for a fairly low-probability failure mode (Supabase project/account itself being lost, as opposed to accidental data loss within it, which Pro covers) — all of it was cleanly removed (`git log` around `0f793bb`..`7a94cc3`). **If backups ever come up again: Supabase Pro is the actual safety net now — don't assume it's unhandled.**
- ✅ **Full visual pass across every remaining coach + client-portal surface** (dashboard/client-modal-header/login/log-modal already had atmosphere from the previous session — this pass covered what didn't): real app icon (recreated the user's "BM hex" brand mark from a photo of a design-system slide as static PNGs at every size, replacing a runtime canvas-drawn dumbbell) + `manifest.json`; redone login screen (glass card, brand mark, breathing atmospheric glow, spinner instead of plain text-swap on the button); log-session modal got its own ambient layer (thin rising blue→green streaks — deliberately a different SHAPE than the dot-based ambient elsewhere, was an explicit user request for differentiation); client portal (Home/Train tabs, header/tabbar) brought up to the same glass-card + ambient-canvas treatment as the coach dashboard, while deliberately leaving the actual workout-LOGGING sheet opaque (data-entry surfaces stay opaque for readability, browsing surfaces go glass — established rule, applied consistently); client-modal body (Program/Progress tabs) + Business tab + Programs tab template list converted from flat `var(--surface2)` fills to the same near-transparent glass card treatment as everywhere else. Also started (not finished, ongoing) chipping away at inline-style sprawl by introducing real shared classes (`.icon-btn`,`.pill-btn`,`.pill-btn-danger`,`.spinner-sm`,`.btn:disabled`) and converting call sites as screens get touched, rather than one unverifiable whole-file sweep.
- ✅ **Ambient v4 (final of this session):** blur was smearing the tiny motes invisible → cards now **near-fully transparent** (`rgba(16,22,29,0.22)`, border-defined, no backdrop-filter; grid rows 0.2 with border 0.12); compact-row hover bg-swap removed earlier stays. Particles **+20%** → 48–102 (area/13300).
- ✅ **Mid-workout draft survival (user: locking phone between sets sometimes lost the in-progress log).** Root cause found by audit: draft saved per keystroke + cold-start restore both worked, BUT any freshly-opened log modal's deferred render ran `saveDraftCoach()` on empty inputs — so after an iOS page eviction, tapping into a client (or "Up next") **faster than `restoreDraftCoach` fired overwrote the draft with empties**. Fixes: (1) `saveDraftCoach` now REFUSES to overwrite with an empty draft (hasData guard — empty states are never stored; explicit `clearDraftCoach` on complete/cancel is unaffected). (2) New `_tryFillFromDraft(clientId)` called from `openLogSession`'s deferred render (all 3 branches): if the stored draft is for THIS client and the modal is untouched, it refills program rows + ad-hoc rows + note — **switching the dropdown to the draft's day** if a different day was preselected; never clobbers live input (`_coachLogHasData` guard); re-persists + toasts "In-progress session restored ✓". (3) `restoreDraftCoach` simplified to just `openLogSession(draft.clientId, draft.dayIndex)` — fill happens via the same `_tryFillFromDraft` path. (4) `visibilitychange→hidden` runs `saveDraftCoach()` as insurance at the instant iOS suspends the page. Nav-blocking rejected: modal already covers the tab bar (z 200 > 100).
- ✅ **Frosted-glass cards (ambient v3 — user: cards block the background).** Card surfaces converted from opaque `var(--surface)` to `rgba(16,22,29,0.55)` + `backdrop-filter:blur(16px)` (+-webkit-): `.card`/`.stat-card`/`.client-card` (shared CSS line), dashboard stat tiles + Today ring card (inline), Clients-grid compact rows (`rgba(23,29,38,0.5)`, blur 14px). Particles now glow through every card as soft diffuse light. Modals/sheets/inputs stay OPAQUE deliberately (readability + full-screen blur cost). Also fixed pre-existing compact-row hover that set `this.style.background=''` on mouseout — with inline glass backgrounds that wiped the card bg entirely after a tap (hover bg-swap removed, border-only now). **Perf note:** ~10 live blur regions on screen at once — fine on modern iPhones; if older-device jank is ever reported, drop the blur and keep translucency. Root cause of vanishing: canvas was `z-index:-1` — **iOS culls fixed layers at negative z-index behind composited scroll layers** (the transformed/touch-scrolled `.view`s), so it painted during load then disappeared. Now canvas `z-index:0` + `main{position:relative;z-index:1}` (content above, canvas between body bg and content). Visibility: 40–85 particles (area/16000), alpha 0.12–0.38, r up to 2.6, **soft halo on motes r>1.7**, bottom glow 0.17. Robustness: `ensure()` single-loop manager restarted by `visibilitychange` + `pageshow` (bfcache restores don't fire visibilitychange) + `focus`. Nav/tabbar frost 0.92→0.84 so motes glow through. Auth screen (fixed z:999 opaque) covers it on login — fine.
- ✅ **Ambient particle background** (user idea: "dark ethereal vibe… light and dust particles radiating from the bottom"). IIFE at end of main script creates `#ambient-bg` canvas, `position:fixed;inset:0;z-index:-1;pointer-events:none` + CSS bottom radial glow (`rgba(37,99,235,0.10)` at 50% 108%). 26–54 motes (area-scaled), spawn at bottom, drift up slowly with sideways wander, sin-twinkle, `depth` fade (brighter near the bottom light source), 82% blue hue 208 / 18% teal 160, alpha ≤~0.22. Battery: pauses on `visibilitychange`, DPR capped at 2, `prefers-reduced-motion` → static single draw. Coach portal only (client portal replaces `document.body`). Pages are transparent so it shows everywhere cards aren't; nav/tabbar blur lets it glow through faintly.
- ✅ **Avatar rainbow fixed + modal safe-area.** (1) User: saturated per-client tiles made the roster "a big rainbow… like a Google doc" — `_avatarStyle` redesigned to **dark glassy tiles** (`#1b2330→#11151d` gradient) with the client hue as a WHISPER: `radial-gradient` tinted glint at the top-left corner (alpha 0.30), hue-tinted hairline border (0.22), **initials carry the color** (`hsl(h,60%,72%)`); golden-angle `_clientHue` kept underneath. (2) Client modal content started under the iOS status bar (the `.modal` drops from physical screen top under `viewport-fit=cover`) — `padding-top:calc(28px + env(safe-area-inset-top))`.
- ✅ **Visual phase 4 — "the factor" (user: app felt "very simple"): atmosphere + identity + life.** (1) **Atmosphere**: `.view` gets a fixed radial brand-blue glow bleeding from the top (`radial-gradient(620px 300px at 50% -110px,rgba(37,99,235,0.13),transparent)` — background sticks to the scroll container so it stays put); surface tokens lifted one shade (`--surface:#10161d`, `--surface2:#171d26`, `--surface3:#1d242f`) so cards read as material not outlines; dashboard stat numbers cast their color (`text-shadow:0 0 26px ${col}55`, hex cols only). (2) **Signature element**: `renderTodaySessions` rebuilt around a 64px **gradient progress ring** (SVG, `#todayRingGrad` #2563eb→#43d9a2, count centered, drop-shadow glow, animated dashoffset; all-done = solid green + ✓ state); old dots + thin bar removed; expand-list behavior unchanged. (3) **Life**: deterministic per-client avatars — `_clientHue(c)` hashes id into curated `_AVATAR_HUES` [212,262,291,340,12,32,160,187,225,145] (no muddy hues), `_avatarStyle(c,size)` gradient tile; dashboard rows 46px (was uniform blue), Clients grid rows 38px (was a bare tier dot — dot now sits beside the name). Palette/fonts/layout deliberately untouched.
- ✅ **Visual phases 3b–3e (the four-part "professional build" pass, all shipped).** (3b) **Client-modal Overview declutter**: package hero card = label + quiet "Renew ↻" text-action top-right + big number + start date + progress bar + ONE full-width "+ Log Session" (was a messy 3-button stack: primary/ghost/tiny Export); Export moved into the bottom utility row (Edit / Pause / Export equal-width); "Remove Client" demoted from full-width red button to a small dim "Remove client…" text link. (3c) **Emoji→monochrome sweep in chrome**: "📋 From Library"→text, "✨ Generate Next Program"→sparkle stroke-SVG, "✨ Next Program" header→text, "🔄 Regenerate"→"↻", "🔍 Review Demos"→text (×2 incl. toggle). Kept "moment" emoji (⚡ CTAs, 🏆 PBs, Crushed-it). (3d) **Skeletons**: `loadTemplates`/`loadRunPrograms` now show shimmer rows when their list is empty-loading (rest of app already had them). (3e) **Entrance motion**: `rowIn` keyframe + `_staggerIn(container,limit)` helper; dashboard alerts (limit 6) + dashboard client rows + Clients grid cascade in 26ms apart on FIRST render only (gates `_dashRowsAnimated`/`_clientGridAnimated`, skipped while searching so keystroke re-renders stay instant).
- ✅ **Visual phase 3a: native-app feel pass** (user goal: "professional app, not a website someone built"). CSS: `-webkit-tap-highlight-color:transparent` + `touch-action:manipulation` on body (no grey flash / no double-tap zoom), `user-select:none` on chrome (nav/tabbar/btns/badges), `button:active` scale(0.965), `@media (hover:none){div[onclick]:active{opacity:.72}}` = every tappable card dims like a native cell, `.view{overscroll-behavior-y:contain}`, `theme-color` meta. Dashboard alert emoji (⚠️/🔔) → stroke SVGs (`.alert-icon` now flex). Dashboard `stat-val` count-up on FIRST load only (`window._statsAnimated` gate). **Remaining phases discussed:** client-modal Overview declutter, emoji→SVG sweep in persistent chrome, consistent skeletons.
- ✅ **Gen-program exercise ORDER fixed** (user report: generated push day led with cable crossovers). Three-part fix in the generator: (1) `_exMechanic(name)` classifier — isolation name-cues (`_GEN_ISO_RE` fly/crossover/raise/curl/extension/…) override the dataset label (dataset tags some flyes "compound"!), then dataset mechanic, then `_GEN_COMP_RE`; `_genCandMech(e)` applies the same override to candidates. (2) `_altExerciseFor`: mechanic is now a **HARD pool filter** per slot (was only a +3 score bonus) with heuristic fallback when the original doesn't match the dataset — an unmatched original no longer makes the slot a free-for-all; lead slot = compounds-only unless the original deliberately led with an isolation. (3) `_genOrderDay(exs)` — final stable partition per generated day: compound units first, isolation after, SS groups move as one unit (compound if any member is); called at the end of `_buildGenProgram`. Validated offline vs the 873-exercise dataset (sloppy-ordered push/pull days → every trial leads with a real compound, flyes classify isolation).
- ✅ **iOS screenshot fixes (post bottom-tab-bar).** (1) Status bar overlapped the logo: `viewport-fit=cover` extends the page under the notch — `nav` height/padding now use `env(safe-area-inset-top)`, `main` padding-top matches, client-portal sticky header padded too. (2) "Weird grey square" bottom-center = the EMPTY toast peeking out (its hidden state was a fixed 100px translateY slide, no longer off-screen after the toast was lifted above the tab bar) — hidden state is now `opacity:0` + 24px drop + `pointer-events:none`; `.toast.show` restores opacity.
- ✅ **Coach nav → bottom tab bar (visual rework phase 2).** The top `.nav-tabs` (horizontally scrollable, hid tabs with no affordance) is REMOVED; coach portal now has `#coach-tabbar` (fixed bottom, 5 `.ctab` buttons: Home/Clients/Library/Programs/Business, icon over 10px Syne label, active = accent color only). Top `nav` slimmed to a 56px brand bar (logo + sign-out). Wiring: `showView` clears `.nav-tab,.ctab` (scrollIntoView dropped); swipe-view sync selector → `.ctab`; `showAuthScreen`/`hideAuthScreen` toggle the tabbar; `.view` bottom padding `calc(112px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`; toast lifted above the bar; viewport meta gained `viewport-fit=cover` (required for env() insets on iPhone). Client portal untouched (it replaces `document.body` so the coach bar never shows there).
- ✅ **FULL 3-AGENT AUDIT + fix sweep (23 findings, all verified & fixed or triaged).** Highest impact: (1) **ISO date filters on the TEXT `session_date` column were lexicographic no-ops** — PR-this-month badge, `renderMonthlyReport`, `renderBusinessView` ("Inactive 10+" never flagged anyone), and `openProgressReport` were all computing on ALL-TIME data; now fetch-all + client-side date bucketing (grep `lexicographic` for the four sites). (2) **Every portal save retry made idempotent** (program-day `_doPortalSave` two-stage `_sessSaved`/`_patchDone`; `_logRunSession` ×2 copies keyed `_runSaveState`; custom `_custSaveState` reset in `renderCustomWorkoutSheet`; coach `_coachSharedUpdated` separate flag) — retries could previously duplicate sessions, double-decrement remaining, double-advance run weeks. All client PATCHes now `r.ok`-checked. (3) **`saveEditSession` no longer DELETEs all logs for the date then re-inserts** (wiped other same-date sessions' logs; delete-then-fail lost logs) — now snapshot old ids → bulk POST new → DELETE `id=in.(...)`, worst case duplicates never loss. (4) **Portal Home calendar-strip workout tap was a ReferenceError** (closure-local `renderWorkoutCard` in inline onclick → `window._showPortalDay(i)`). (5) `_attr()`-escaped user data in edit-session/run-day/body-stat `value="…"` attrs. (6) Renew NaN guard + non-standard package sizes get an injected option. (7) Portal decrement rule aligned with coach (`pkg>0||remaining>0` — pay-per-session self-logs now charge). (8) Heatmap "month" divides by ELAPSED weeks not fixed 4.33. (9) Draft re-persisted after restore (was empty-overwritten by the deferred render). (10) Portal body-stat save failure now alerts. (11) Day-name fetches dropped `order=session_date.desc&limit=N` (alphabetical text sort under a limit returned wrong rows). **Known-accepted, NOT fixed:** absolute-value `remaining`/`exercise_history` writes can lose one update if coach + client log concurrently (architectural; needs server-side increment RPC); shared-package overuse past 0 is untracked/free; `_toggleSessions` dead code.
- ✅ **"From Library" on client page showed "No saved programs"** — `templates` only loaded on Programs-tab open; `openAssignFromLibrary` now fetches on demand (skeleton + silent refresh).
- ✅ **Visual declutter pass 1** (user wants sleek/modern/less cluttered, NO new data-density): neutral hairline `--border`/`--border2` (was blue-tinted everywhere), nav pill flattened (no border ring/inset), active-tab glow halved, alerts flat (bg + left accent only, no gradient/border), dashboard `mkStat` tiles calmed — one surface, color only in the number, warn/danger tiles muted when zero. **Next visual steps discussed:** per-screen declutter (client modal Overview, portal Home), consistent press states/skeletons; user will react on phone first.
- ✅ **"Last logged / X ago" date labels FIXED.** Dashboard cards (and client-portal "last done") computed relative time as `Math.floor(elapsedMs / 86400000)` — **elapsed 24h windows, not calendar days** — so a session logged yesterday evening read "Today" the next morning, and 2-days-ago read "Yesterday". New `_relDayLabel(x)` (accepts a Date or session) compares **local calendar days** via `_sessDayDate` (prefers the session's stored `date` string over the UTC `created_at` to avoid TZ drift). `Math.round` so DST 23/25h days don't misclassify. Replaced both coach call sites (`renderClientModal` card variants ~2124/2157) + portal `fmtAgo`.
- ✅ **Coach save reliability audit (income-critical).** Confirmed: (a) the session-history **list shows every session** from `c._sessions` (no date filter / dedup that could hide one), and (b) `showSuccessAnimation` fires **only after** the awaits succeed (seeing it = saved) — so a missing session means it was never submitted (forgot Complete, or a transient failure shown only as a fleeting toast). Hardening in `confirmLogSession`: **empty-session confirm guard**; side-effects guarded by `window._coachSessionSaved` / `window._coachClientUpdated` (reset in `openLogSession`) so a **Retry can't duplicate the session or double-decrement** the package; failure now turns the button into a persistent **red "↻ Save failed — Retry"** (modal stays open, data intact) instead of a transient toast. (Recommended next safeguard, not yet built: a dashboard "today: X logged / Y scheduled" so a miss is caught same-day, not at week's end.)
- ✅ **Client self-logged workouts silently missing from history — FIXED.** Root cause: the **program-day** portal save (`_logPortalSession`) rendered the "Crushed it!" success screen *optimistically* (inside a `setTimeout`, before the network POST resolved) and only showed failures as a tiny "Save failed" line — so a flaky-wifi log looked identical to success and the session was never written. Now: (1) empty-session guard (must log ≥1 set); (2) save wrapped in `_doPortalSave()` with a **loud, retryable** failure (`window._retryPortalSave`, data held in closure so Retry needs no re-entry); success text only flips to "✓ Saved" once it persists; draft is kept on failure for reload recovery. (The custom-workout path already gated success on the save.)
- ✅ **Package start date** — new `clients.package_started_at` (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`). Stamped today on **renew** (`confirmRenew`) and on **package change** in the edit form (`saveEditClient`: a manual edit to the new `#ecPkgStart` date input wins/backdates; otherwise auto-stamps today when `package_size`/`remaining` changed). Shown as "📅 Package started …" on the client card (`_fmtPkgStart`, tz-safe). Writes go through `_updateClientSafe` which retries without the field if the column isn't migrated yet. **One-time SQL:** `ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS package_started_at date;`
- ✅ **Generate Next Program** (coach) — `generateNextProgram(clientId)` button at the bottom of the Program tab (`renderStructuredProgram`). Deep-clones the current `structured_program` (same day names/colors, same prescriptions/loads, same superset SS-prefixes) but swaps each exercise for a fresh variation hitting the **same primary muscle + mechanic** via the demo dataset. **Inline Edit mode** in the preview sheet: a big **✎ Edit Exercises** toggle (`_genToggleEdit`/`window._genEditMode`) turns each row into editable name (autocomplete + live thumb via `_exAcInput`/`_syncRowThumb`) + sets/reps + load, with per-day **+ Add exercise** (`_genAddEx`) and × remove (`_genDelEx`); `_genReadEditInputs` syncs DOM→`window._genProgram` (SS prefixes preserved) on every toggle/structural change and before Apply (which also drops blank rows). Flow: generate skeleton → tweak by hand → Apply. `_altExerciseFor(name,used,first)` ranks candidates (`_altScore`: same mechanic +3, gym-staple equipment +2/2.5, level, **+3 recognizable staple** via `_genCommonIds` = dataset ids the curated `_EX_SUGGEST` resolve to, **−3 odd phrasing** `_GEN_ODD_RE` kneeling/guillotine/around-the-world/etc, −len penalty for >4-word names), pool hard-filtered by `_genOkEx` (category `strength` + `_GEN_OK_EQUIP` + not `_GEN_BAD_RE` clean/snatch/jump/etc — the dataset is full of strongman/mobility junk). **Slot-aware:** the day's lead lift (`ei===0`) is kept a recognizable compound (compound-only pool) and picked from the top 2; accessory slots pick from the top 6 so some interesting variety still comes through (user wants *some* obscurity, just not as the main lift). Demo z-index: gen sheet is **8800** (< demo sheet 9000) so tapping a thumbnail in edit mode opens the demo on top. `used` map (by `_exIdentity`) seeds with ALL original exercises so nothing repeats. Preview sheet (`_openGenPreview`/`_genPreviewBodyHtml`) shows per-day new exercise + "was: X" + kept prescription, with **🔄 Regenerate** (`_buildGenProgram` reshuffles, randomness among top-5) and **✓ Apply** (`_applyGenProgram`: confirm → strip `_from`/`_swapped` helpers → set new `started_at` → save → `_ensureLibraryHas`). Logged history untouched. Validated swap quality offline against the 873-exercise dataset (Node harness). `_OUR_TO_EXDB` maps our muscle keys→dataset vocab for the fallback when `_exDbMatch` misses.
- ✅ **Progression guide** (coach + client, shared) — replaced the separate "📊 Last" line + "🎯 Target" chip with one unified **"Last time → Do this today"** card (`_progressionGuideHtml`). Now **multi-session aware**: `_buildExSeriesMap(sessions)` builds a per-exercise e1RM series; `_progressionGuide` tags **↗ PROGRESSING** (`up`), neutral (`hold`), or **→ STALLED** and tailors the suggestion (progressing/hold→double-progression add load/rep; stalled→grind +1 rep / small bump / "deload ~10%"). **STALL requires a 3-session plateau or decline** (e1RM flat-or-down across the last 3 sessions) — one flat week stays `hold` (no badge, still suggests pushing for the next jump), per user instruction. `_exGuideFor` falls back to the single `exercise_history` entry when sessions are empty. Coach builds `_serMap` from `c._sessions` in `updateLogWorkout`; portal from `window._portalRecentSessions` in `renderWorkoutCard`. Tap "Last time" → history, tap "Do this today" → fills inputs (`_applyTargetCoach`/`_applyTargetPortal`). Old `_suggestNext` kept for compat.
- ✅ **Client custom-workout save** now verifies the session POST (`if(!r.ok) throw`) before showing "Crushed it!" — was silently swallowing save failures.
- ✅ **Coach log DATA-LOSS bug FIXED** — picking **"↳ Custom Workout"** (or any other day) from the `logDaySelect` dropdown mid-session ran `updateLogWorkout` which **rebuilds `#logExercises` from scratch**, silently wiping every set already typed into the program rows; then `confirmLogSession` saw `di===-1` and **skipped the entire program branch**, saving ONLY the ad-hoc rows. Symptom (reported by user re: Tim): logged a full upper-body program day + added leg raises at the end → only leg raises showed in session history & muscle chart (abs only). Fix: (1) `_onLogDayChange(id,sel)` confirms before switching when `_coachLogHasData()` and reverts the dropdown on cancel (points the coach at "+ Add Exercise" for extra lifts); (2) `updateLogWorkout` records `window._logRenderedDi`; (3) `confirmLogSession` uses `window._logRenderedDi` (the actually-rendered day) instead of re-reading the live dropdown, so the program branch can't be skipped by dropdown drift. **Lost data is unrecoverable** (draft only holds program rows and was overwritten/cleared) — coach must re-log.
- ✅ **Coach draft now covers ad-hoc rows (crash/reload recovery) — last in-progress data-loss gap CLOSED.** Ad-hoc inputs (`an-adhoc-`/`wr-adhoc-`/`wt-adhoc-` + the × delete) now fire `saveDraftCoach()`; `saveDraftCoach` persists the ad-hoc rows in DOM order (`adhoc:[{name,reps,weight}]`) plus the **rendered** day index (`window._logRenderedDi`, so a Custom Workout di=-1 is captured correctly); `restoreDraftCoach` rebuilds them flat (clears `#adhoc-exercises`, resets `_adhocCount`, re-adds via `addAdHocExercise()` then fills) — matches how ad-hoc rows are saved (flat, no SS). `restoreDraftCoach()` runs in `init()` after clients load. Backward-compatible with old drafts (no `adhoc` key → `[]`).
- ✅ **Coach log-modal safety** — `closeLogSession(force)` confirms before discarding an in-progress session; wired to the **Cancel** button and the **backdrop-tap** (the global `.modal-overlay` click handler now special-cases `logModal`). `_coachLogHasData()` checks program-day rows (`wr-`/`wt-`) **and** ad-hoc/custom rows (`an-adhoc-`/`wr-adhoc-`/`wt-adhoc-`) + note. (Crash/reload is now recoverable via the draft too — see entry above.)
- ✅ **Audit "Verified ✓" checkoff** — per-exercise "✓ OK" button in Review Demos stores `bm_exverified` (localStorage, keyed by `_normExName`); verified rows force `sev=0` so they drop out of "Show only flagged". `window._libRevToggleVerified(name)`, `_isExVerified`, `_libVerifiedMap`. Summary shows verified count; category counts exclude verified.
- ✅ **Autocomplete dropdown scrollable** — `#_ex-ac-drop` was `overflow:hidden` with no height cap (suggestions below the keyboard unreachable). Now `overflow-y:auto` + `touch-action:pan-y`, height capped to available space, flips above the input when there's more room up top.
- ✅ **Exercise audit — "Review Demos" upgraded to a smart triage view (Library tab).** `_renderLibReview` now flags likely-wrong matches instead of making the coach eyeball all ~200. (1) **Confidence tier:** `_exDbMatch` sets `_exMatchTier` (`alias`/`exact`/`token-curated`=trust, `token`=fuzzy, `fallback`=guessed/risky, `none`). (2) **Demo↔muscle disagreement:** compares the matched demo's group (`_demoMuscleGroup`) vs our `exerciseToMuscles()` top group (`_ourTopGroup`, via `_OUR_COARSE` map) → red "muscle mismatch" (catches flutter-kicks-type wrong-on-both). (3) Shows OUR heatmap mapping per row (not just the dataset's), plus "untracked" flag when `exerciseToMuscles` returns nothing. Rows sorted problems-first by severity; summary counts; "Show only flagged" toggle (`window._libRevOnlyFlagged`). `Fix ✎`→`openEditLibEx` unchanged. **Next audit pieces offered but NOT yet built:** (4) "Verified ✓" checkoff (localStorage) to shrink the list; (5) matcher fixes e.g. rope/V-bar/EZ-bar/straight-bar = cable attachments (overhead rope extension → cable, not dumbbell); (6) offline batch triage report. Validate any matcher change with the Node harness ("blank beats wrong").
- ✅ **"Log This Workout Again"** in the read-only session viewer (`_showSessionDetail`): `window._repeatThisWorkout` dispatches by ctx → `_repeatWorkoutPortal` (client custom sheet) or `_repeatWorkoutCoach` (coach ad-hoc log, di=-1), pre-filling name/reps/weight. Superset prefixes flattened (custom savers store flat names). Viewer also got **swipe-down-to-dismiss** + grab handle (safe — read-only, no in-progress data; opposite of the workout sheet).
- ✅ **Custom-workout drag-reorder — FIXED & confirmed on the user's iPhone (both portals).** The whole prior multi-session saga was a **wiring bug, not a gesture bug**. The `_setupBlockDrag` pointer-event engine (`~line 2889`, reparent block to `<body>` + placeholder + DOM reorder; `_blockDrag` flag) was fine all along.
  - **Root cause (coach side):** `updateLogWorkout`'s Custom-Workout branch (`di===-1`) builds the ad-hoc rows then `return`s **before** the line that calls `_setupBlockDrag(#adhoc-exercises)` (that call only lived in the program-day branch). So on the coach Custom Workout screen the drag listener was **never attached** — every prior "approach" was tuning gesture code that wasn't running. Fix: added `_setupBlockDrag(document.getElementById('adhoc-exercises'))` inside the `di===-1` branch.
  - **Root cause (client side):** code was already correct (`renderCustomWorkoutSheet` calls `_setupCustomDrag()` → `_setupBlockDrag(#custom-ex-list)`); the "broken" report was a **stale Safari cache** on `pt-hub.vercel.app`. A reload showed the `⠿` handles and drag worked (confirmed via temp on-screen HUD: clean `pointerdown→grabbed→50+ moves→POINTERUP`, no `pointercancel`).
  - **Diagnosis method that cracked it:** a temporary on-screen debug HUD (`_dbg`) inside `_setupBlockDrag` logging pointerdown/move/up/cancel. It revealed "no HUD at all" on the coach screen = listener never attached. HUD has since been **removed**.
  - **Also fixed same pass — swipe-to-dismiss removed.** `#workout-sheet` had swipe-down-to-close handlers (the two `_swipeListenersAdded` blocks) that could discard an in-progress/finished-but-unlogged workout (catastrophic). **Both removed**; the sheet now closes only via the deliberate "← Back" button. (Coach log uses a `.modal`, unaffected.)
- **Smarter PRs by estimated 1RM (Epley)**: all PR/PB detection now uses `_bestE1RM` (rep PRs at same weight count). Touched coach live badge + `confirmLogSession` (program-day + ad-hoc), client portal live badge + `_logPortalSession` + `_logCustomPortalSession`, and client Home "PRs this month" chip. PRs *tab* (`renderPortalPRs`) already used e1RM. +0.01 float tolerance.
- **Tap a completed session to view it**: read-only `_showSessionDetail(s,histCtx)` (~line 3627, z-index 8900 so demo sheet 9000 layers above). Wired to coach session-history rows (`_coachShowSession`) and client Home "Recent Workouts" rows (`_portalShowSession`). Home "Recent Workouts" list made prominent (accent bar + Syne heading + "Tap to view").
- **Abbreviation matching**: `exerciseToMuscles` normalizes `oh→overhead, db→dumbbell, bb→barbell, kb→kettlebell` at the top; `_EX_ABBR` got `oh→overhead`. Rescues pre-dropdown hand-typed programs ("OH DB Extension" etc.).
- **DB-connect resilience**: `sb()` retries GET 3× w/ backoff; `init()` only fatal on clients fetch (equipment etc. `.catch`); error box has ↻ Retry + shows real error. (A "could not connect" report turned out to be the user's WiFi having no real internet path to Supabase.)
- **Exercise accuracy pass**: fixed muscle-chart mappings (0 untracked of 182) + blank/wrong demos. Notable demo aliases added: chest dips, reverse lunge, sissy squat, overhead/OH DB extension→Standing_Dumbbell_Triceps_Extension, machine dip(s)→Dip_Machine, hamstring curl(s)→Lying/Seated_Leg_Curl. Muscle-chart fixes: close-grip lat pulldown→back, wrist curl→forearms, nordic curl→hamstrings, cable crossover/svend→chest, reverse pec deck→shoulders, hanging knee raise/flutter/wood chop/hollow/med-ball-slam→abs, rack pull→back, thruster/farmers walk/sled push/olympic lifts/burpee mapped.

**Verification harness** (rebuild after edits to test matcher/muscle mapping in Node): a Python extractor pulls `_EX_ALIAS`, `_exDbMatch`, `exerciseToMuscles`, etc. from index.html into `/tmp/lib.js`; load with the dataset at `/tmp/exdb.json` (`curl raw.githubusercontent…free-exercise-db…/dist/exercises.json` with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox:true`). Used to verify exercise demos + muscle mappings without a browser.

### What is WORKING:
- Auto-login (reads `bm_session` from localStorage via `startApp()`)
- Manual sign-in (`signIn()` function)
- All core coaching portal features
- Client modal with **3 swipeable tabs**: Overview / Program / Progress
- Today's Workout card in Overview tab
- Body stats section in Progress tab
- **Exercise Demo & Library System** (BIG — see dedicated section below): tap any exercise anywhere → bottom sheet with animated demo, target-muscle chips, instructions, and history. Backed by the public `free-exercise-db` dataset (873 exercises) loaded at runtime. ~210-entry curated alias map + forgiving matcher.
- Custom exercise details: link a demo / paste image+video URL / muscle multi-select / description (per-library overrides; needs the 5 new `exercise_library` columns).
- Comprehensive exercise autocomplete (curated 182 + 873 dataset + library), token-based forgiving matching.
- Library auto-grows from used exercises (deduped by resolved demo identity).
- Program builder & workout-of-day builder: one-at-a-time **+ Add Exercise / ⊕ Superset**, live thumbnails, orange superset wrappers.
- Muscle heatmap + **muscle-balance bars** (weekly volume vs target) in Progress (coach) and Muscles tab (client)
- **Heatmap breakdown panel** (collapsible) + untracked-exercise warning

- `structured_program` — JSONB: `{ started_at: "May 15, 2026", days: [{name, color, exercises: [{name, prescription, load}]}] }`
- `exercise_history` — JSONB keyed by `exercise_name.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g,'_')`, stores `{reps, weight, date, pb}`
- `shared_package_id`, `paused`

### Sessions table
- `client_id`, `date` (formatted "May 15, 2026"), `note`, `workout` (JSONB array), `created_at`

### Exercise logs table (`exercise_logs`)
- `client_id`, `session_date` (formatted "May 15, 2026"), `exercise_name`, `reps`, `weight`, `day_name`
- **IMPORTANT**: `weight` may be comma-separated. Always use `maxWeight(str)` — never `parseFloat()`
- **IMPORTANT**: `session_date` is stored as US locale text ("Jun 3, 2026"), NOT ISO format. `new Date("Jun 3, 2026")` may parse inconsistently across browsers/timezones.

### Run programs table
- `id`, `name`, `weeks` (JSONB array of arrays of run objects)

### Exercise library table (`exercise_library`)
- `id`, `name`, `muscle_group` (single, used for library grouping), `equipment`
- **Custom-detail columns (added this session — run the SQL below if not present):**
  - `demo_id` — links to a `free-exercise-db` id to reuse its demo
  - `image_url`, `video_url` — custom media (video_url: YouTube auto-embeds, else link button)
  - `description` — coaching cues/notes
  - `muscles` — comma-separated muscle groups (chips in detail sheet)
- SQL: `ALTER TABLE exercise_library ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS demo_id text, ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS image_url text, ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS video_url text, ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS description text, ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS muscles text;` (already run)
- Grows automatically: exercises typed when building programs / logging workouts are added via `_ensureLibraryHas()`, **deduped by resolved demo identity** (so word-order/abbrev variants don't create duplicates).

## Exercise Demo & Library System (major feature — current session)

### Data source
- **`free-exercise-db`** (873 exercises, public domain) loaded at runtime from jsDelivr CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/yuhonas/free-exercise-db@main/dist/exercises.json`. Cached in `localStorage` (`bm_exdb`, 7-day TTL) + `_exDb`/`_exById`/`_exDbIdx` in memory. Each entry: `name, level, mechanic, equipment, primaryMuscles[], secondaryMuscles[], instructions[], images[], id`. Images at `…@main/exercises/<images[i]>`.
- **NOTE:** the CDN host is blocked from the Claude Code remote env (can't fetch in-tool), but it loads fine in the user's browser. To inspect the dataset locally, `curl` raw.githubusercontent with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox:true` works.

### Matching (`_exDbMatch`) — the core, order matters
1. Curated alias on raw normalized name (`_EX_ALIAS`, ~210 hand-verified entries)
2. Brand-machine normalization (Arsenal/Prime/Hammer Strength/Hoist/… → "machine …")
3. Curated alias on `canonExName()` output
4. Exact dataset-name match
5. Order-independent **token** match (abbrev `db→dumbbell`, plurals `curls→curl`) against alias keys then unambiguous dataset names
6. **Subset fallback**: longest known movement fully contained in the name (e.g. "Close Grip Lat Pulldown"→Lat Pulldown). **Requires ≥2-word match** — single-word movements are too broad ("Pendulum Squat" must NOT match "Squat"). Wrong-demo is worse than no-demo: unmatched → blank.

### Discoverability
- Every exercise shows a **thumbnail** (`_exThumbHTML` + `_hydrateExThumbs`) in the library, program builder, log rows, and workout cards. Real start-frame image if matched, dumbbell placeholder otherwise. Tapping it opens `openExerciseDetail`.
- Detail sheet: sticky header with × + swipe-down-to-close; animated demo (alternates start/end frames), equipment/level chips, target-muscle chips, instructions, history chart, and a coach-only **"＋ Add demo & details" / "✎ Edit details"** button (hidden in portal via `!window._portalClientId`).

### Custom details (per-library-entry overrides)
- Editor (`openEditLibEx`/`saveLibraryExercise`): **link an existing demo** (`demo_id`, fastest), or paste image/video URL, multi-select muscle groups (`.mchip`), description.
- `openExerciseDetail` & thumbnails apply override priority: linked `demo_id` → custom `image_url` → dataset match.

### Library growth & dedup
- `_ensureLibraryHas(names)` (called from `saveProgramDay` + `confirmLogSession`) adds any not-already-present exercise, **keyed by `_exIdentity` = resolved demo id (or normalized name)** so naming variants collapse to one row. Novel/unmatched → added bare (muscle_group `Other`).
- Client-portal custom-workout logging NOW feeds the coach library (`_logCustomPortalSession` loads the library first — the portal never runs `init()` — then calls `_ensureLibraryHas`).

### Autocomplete (rewritten)
- `_exAcGetList()` = `_EX_SUGGEST` (182 curated clean names) + `_KNOWN_EXERCISES` + library + **full 873 dataset** (deduped). Loads dataset on first keystroke.
- `_exAcShow` matching is **token-prefix** (order-independent, plural/abbrev-aware), cached via `_exAcTokCache`, top 10.

### Builders (program + workout-of-day are aligned)
- **+ Add Exercise** = one blank row (inline autocomplete). **⊕ Superset** = orange wrapper group + "+ Add to superset". Supersets stored as `SS{n}: name`; editor parses to `.ss` group markers (`_parseExForEdit`) and re-encodes on save (`_encodeEx`).
- The multi-select `openExercisePicker` exists but is **dormant** (user preferred one-at-a-time).

---

## Muscle Heatmap System

### Color scale (`_mhColor`)
```
r = weeklySetTotal / weeklyTarget
r < 0.25  → #fef9c3  (pale yellow  — Minimal, <25%)
r < 0.50  → #fde68a  (light yellow — Below optimal, 25-49%)
r < 0.75  → #fbbf24  (amber        — Building, 50-74%)
r < 1.00  → #f97316  (orange       — Effective, 75-99%)
r < 1.50  → #ef4444  (red          — Optimal, ≥100%)
r >= 1.50 → #b91c1c  (dark red     — High volume, ≥150%)
```

### Weekly targets (`_MH_TARGETS`)
Based on RP Strength MAV guidelines adjusted for PT clients (2-4x/week):
```javascript
chest:12, back:14, shoulders:12, quads:12,
hamstrings:12, glutes:12, glute_med:4, adductors:4,
biceps:14, triceps:12, calves:10, abs:12, traps:8, lower_back:6, forearms:8
```

### Set counting (`parseSets`)
- `"3×10"` or `"3x10"` or `"3X10"` → 3 sets
- `"8,8,6"` (comma-separated) → 3 sets
- `"12"` (just a number) → 1 set

### Breakdown panel (permanent feature)
Below the diagram, a collapsible "▶ Show breakdown" panel lists every muscle group with:
- Total weighted sets for the period
- Each contributing exercise with its set count
This lets coaches and clients verify that all exercises are mapping to the right muscles.
Use this to catch `exerciseToMuscles()` mis-mappings (e.g., the Reverse Fly → chest bug found Jun 4).

### Muscle-balance bars (`_muscleBalanceHtml`, current session)
Rendered right below the diagram (coach Progress + client Muscles): one ranked bar per `_MH_TARGETS` muscle showing weekly sets vs target (`X/Y sets/wk · NN%`), heatmap color scale, target marker at 66.6% of bar (= 100% of target), sorted most→least trained so over/under-worked muscles are obvious. Reuses the heatmap's `scores`/`weeksInPeriod` — no extra fetch.

### Per-exercise strength charts (current session)
The detail sheet's history (`_exHistHtml` + `_exChartRender`) is a strength-progression view: **Est. 1RM** (Epley on the best set/session via `_bestE1RM`) by default, toggle to **Top Wt** / **Volume** (`_sessionVolume`), headline (current value, % change, 🏆 on all-time best), per-session bars, recent sets. **Client-specific**: portal passes the client's own pts (`_portalExPts`); coach passes the *viewed* client's pts (`_coachExPts` via `_openExDetailCoach`, wired by `coach:<clientId>` thumbnail context). Library detail (no client) shows demo only.

### Muscle diagram (`renderMuscleDiagram`)
- Stock anatomical SVG (workout-planner). Colors `<g id="...">` groups by setting a group `style="fill:..."`; child `.st4/.st5` paths converted to `fill:inherit`. `muscleMappings` wires our muscle keys → SVG group ids.
- **Untrained muscles blend into the body color** (`c()` 0-score fallback = `rgba(15,35,65,0.6)`, opacity 1) so there are no stark gray "holes"; trained muscles use the heat scale.
- Per-region tweak: the two long inner-thigh strands (`M760.41`/`M1015.98`) are repainted with the quad color (anatomically quad, were in `hip_adductor`).
- **Known stock-SVG limitations** (defer to visual rework / asset swap): lower-back drawn as two outward "wings" not a single erector block; `hip_abductor` (glute_med) region a bit large; thigh split across quads/adductor/abductor groups. Reshaping paths can't be done reliably "blind" — needs a better-segmented SVG.

### Untracked exercise warning
Any exercise that `exerciseToMuscles()` can't map appears in a yellow warning box below the diagram.
This also means it won't appear in PRs — the signal to add new exercises to `exerciseToMuscles()`.

### Known `exerciseToMuscles()` gotchas
- **`\bfly\b` pattern must exclude "reverse" and "rear"** — "Reverse Fly" contains "fly" and would falsely map to chest. Guard is: `!n.includes('reverse')&&!n.includes('rear')&&/...\bfly\b/.test(n)`.
- Chest-supported rows (e.g., "Chest Supported Row") — "chest" in name does NOT mean chest muscle. The regex avoids this because it requires "chest" + "press" or "fly" keywords together, not standalone.
- Order matters: more specific patterns (reverse fly, rear delt) must come BEFORE broad patterns (fly, press).

### `exerciseToMuscles()` coverage (regex-based, broad)
All bench/push-up variants → chest; all curl variants → biceps; pull-up/pulldown/row → back; squat/leg press/lunge → quads; hip thrust/glute bridge → glutes; deadlift → back+glutes+hams; RDL → hams+glutes; shoulder press/lateral raise/face pull → shoulders; tricep pushdowns/skull crushers/dips → triceps; etc.
**Reverse fly / rear delt fly / band pull-apart** → shoulders (NOT chest).

### Secondary-muscle weights (calibrated current session, EMG-informed)
- **Chest press** → chest 1.0, triceps 0.5, **shoulders 0.3** (was 0.4)
- **Horizontal rows** → back 1.0, **traps 0.6** (mid-trap/rhomboid; was 0.25), biceps 0.4, forearms 0.25
- **Vertical pulls** (pull-up/pulldown) → back 1.0, **biceps 0.35** (was 0.5, lat-dominant), traps 0.3, forearms 0.2
- **Chin-up** → back 1.0, biceps 0.45, traps 0.3
- **Bench guard**: the chest `/bench|push.?up/` rule is guarded `&& !/thrust|glute|bridge|\brow\b|step.?up|sit.?up|crunch/` so "Hip Thrust on Bench", bench rows, etc. fall through to their correct mapping (don't get tagged chest).

### `canonExName()` normalization (applied at save time)
Canonical list of ~40 known exercises + loaded library → case-insensitive match. Falls back to synonym table (~80 mappings: rdl→Romanian Deadlift, ohp→Overhead Press, bss→Bulgarian Split Squat, etc.). Applied in `_logCustomPortalSession` and `confirmLogSession` ad-hoc section.

---

## Custom Workout System

### Client Portal (`window.renderCustomWorkoutSheet`)
- Opened by "Custom Workout" card at bottom of Train tab
- Two buttons: **+ Add Exercise** and **⊕ Superset**
- Superset wrapper card uses **orange** `⊕ SUPERSET` styling (aligned with program builder; was blue)
- Exercise rows now show a **live thumbnail** next to the name (`_syncRowThumb`)
- Exercise name inputs use custom typeahead autocomplete (not native datalist)
- Placeholder text shows format: `"3×10 · or 8,8,6"` and `"135 · or 135,145,155"`
- On save: `canonExName()` normalizes names, then saves to `sessions` + `exercise_logs` + patches `exercise_history`
- Shows "Crushed it!" success screen with PB detection

### Coach Portal (log session modal with dayIdx = -1)
- Triggered by "Custom Workout" card in Program tab → `openLogSession(id, -1)`
- Same "Add Exercise" + "⊕ Superset" two-button layout
- Uses `addAdHocExercise()` and `addAdHocSuperset()`
- `confirmLogSession()` uses `adhocDayName='Custom Workout'` for day_name

---

## Client Portal — 5 Tabs

```
Home | Train | PRs | Body | Muscles
```

- **Home**: greeting, today's workout hero, week calendar, session history
- **Train**: program days + Custom Workout card at bottom; LOG button opens workout sheet
- **PRs**: all-time PRs + "🏆 New in [Month]" section showing PRs hit this month
- **Body**: body stats (weight, body fat, muscle mass) — NO heatmap, NO recent sessions
- **Muscles**: dedicated heatmap with period selector + "ⓘ How it works" button + breakdown panel

Tab bar uses `grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr)` — all 5 tabs in one row.

---

## Autocomplete Dropdown (`_exAcShow`)

Singleton `#_ex-ac-drop` div, `position:fixed`, `z-index:9999`. Active on:
- Client portal custom workout: `cex-name-N` inputs
- Coach ad-hoc: `an-adhoc-N` inputs
- Program builder: exercise name inputs in `.edit-ex-fields`

Behavior:
- Shows on 1+ character typed; **token-prefix match** (order-independent, plural/abbrev-aware via `_exTokArr`), max 10 results, ranked (startsWith first, then shorter)
- Candidate pool = `_EX_SUGGEST` (182) + `_KNOWN_EXERCISES` + library + **full 873 dataset**; dataset loads on first keystroke; tokenized candidates cached in `_exAcTokCache`
- Matched text highlighted in blue
- Tap → fills input + auto-advances focus to reps/prescription field
- Position updated via `requestAnimationFrame` + `window.visualViewport` offsets (fixes iOS keyboard position drift)
- Hides on blur (160ms delay), Escape key, scroll, or `visualViewport` resize

---

## Auto-Login Flow (CRITICAL — do not break)

`startApp()` at ~line 1050 — reads `bm_session` from localStorage. **The user NEVER manually clicks Sign In.** If auto-login breaks, Face ID prompt appears and Sign In button does nothing.

---

## 3-Tab Client Modal (Coach)

Tabs: **Overview / Program / Progress**
- Overview: today's workout card (lift or run), package status, session history, goals/injuries
- Program: structured program days (drag-reorder in edit mode), Custom Workout card at bottom
- Progress: monthly stats, body stats, muscle heatmap

**Today's Workout card** (Overview tab):
- Blue card for lift days: workout name, full exercise list with last logged weights (from exercise_history), superset indent bars, "✓ Logged" badge if today's session exists
- Orange card for run days: label, distance/pace, week progress
- Hidden on rest days
- Tapping → `openLogSession(clientId, dayIdx)`

---

## Known Patterns & Gotchas
- **Line numbers shift** every session — always grep to find current positions
- **`parseSchedule(str)`** handles both JSON `{"Mon":0}` and plain text "Mon, Wed" formats
- **`window._portalClientId`** etc. — client portal uses global window vars
- **Session date format**: `"May 15, 2026"` (US locale), NOT ISO — used for matching/display
- **`exercise_logs.session_date`**: also US locale text. `new Date("Jun 3, 2026")` parses inconsistently across browsers/timezones — potential bug in "This Week" filter
- **`exercise_logs` is the source for the client PRs tab AND the muscle heatmap.** The portal *program-day* save (`_logPortalSession`) used to write only `sessions` + `exercise_history`, so self-logging clients had empty PRs/Muscles. Fixed (now writes `exercise_logs` too, SS-prefix stripped). Historical sessions were backfilled via a one-time SQL (`INSERT INTO exercise_logs … FROM sessions, jsonb_array_elements(workout) … NOT EXISTS`). The coach `confirmLogSession` and the custom-workout path always wrote it.
- **Superset rows inside ssWrap**: `querySelectorAll('[id^="custom-ex-row-"]')` finds them regardless of nesting — save loop still works
- **`renderCustomWorkoutSheet` must be `window.renderCustomWorkoutSheet`** (not a local function) — inline onclick handlers are global scope only
- **Tab background**: inactive tabs must use `background:'transparent'` not `background:''`
- **SQL in Supabase**: apostrophes must be escaped as `''`
- **Supabase blocked** from Claude Code remote env — can't curl Supabase directly. The **demo CDN (jsDelivr) is also blocked in-tool** but loads in the user's browser; use `curl raw.githubusercontent … dangerouslyDisableSandbox:true` to inspect the dataset.
- **Syne font / silent CSS failures**: invalid `rgba(#hex)` and curly-quote `font-family` rules fail silently and fall back. Fixing the smart quotes made Syne actually load (wider) → collapsed the Edit-modal name field (`grid-template-columns:1fr auto auto` + intrinsic-width inputs). Watch tight `auto`-column input grids — give inputs `width:100%`.
- **`_jsq(s)`** escapes `\ ' "` for exercise names inside inline `onclick` attributes (used by demo taps).
- **`let`/`const` top-level globals are NOT on `window`** (only `var`). `library`, `clients`, etc. must be referenced directly, not `window.library`.

---

## Pending / Known Issues

- **Joe's program**: SQL fix for apostrophes was provided; confirm "1 row affected" in Supabase
- **Chris's api_tokens**: Run `api/_migration.sql` once before `/api/v1/export` will work
- **Jeff's schedule**: `schedule` field may not say "Tue, Thu, Fri" yet
- **`exerciseToMuscles()` ongoing calibration**: As more users test and the breakdown panel surfaces mis-mappings, add new exercise patterns. Use the yellow "untracked" warning + breakdown panel as the feedback loop.

---

## Features Completed (current session — exercise/library/builder overhaul)

- ✅ **Exercise demo system** — `free-exercise-db` (873) runtime-loaded; tap any exercise → bottom sheet (animated demo, muscles, instructions, history); thumbnails everywhere
- ✅ **Forgiving matcher** (`_exDbMatch`): curated `_EX_ALIAS` (~210), brand-machine normalization, token (order/abbrev/plural), ≥2-word subset fallback; "blank beats wrong"
- ✅ **Smart-quote fix** made Syne font actually load → fixed Edit-modal name-field collapse (`1fr auto auto` → name on own row)
- ✅ **Comprehensive autocomplete** — 182 curated + 873 dataset + library, token-prefix matching, cached
- ✅ **Library auto-grows** from used exercises, **deduped by demo identity** (no DB/word-order dupes)
- ✅ **Custom exercise details** — link demo / image+video URL / muscle multi-select / description (5 new `exercise_library` columns; YouTube embeds)
- ✅ **One-at-a-time builders** restored (program + workout-of-day) with **⊕ Superset** groups, live thumbnails, **orange** superset wrappers everywhere
- ✅ **Multi-select search-picker** built then made dormant (user preferred one-at-a-time)
- ✅ **Muscle-balance bars** (weekly volume vs target) below heatmap
- ✅ **Bigger coach nav tabs** (always-labeled), **Today's Workout card** redesign, removed debug logs

---

## Next Logical Steps (in priority order)

1. ✅ **DONE — Smarter PRs (estimated-1RM)**: all PR/PB detection now uses `_bestE1RM` (Epley) everywhere (see session log).
   - **"Repeat this workout" button** (requested, not urgent): add a "＋ Log this again" button in the `_showSessionDetail` viewer that pre-loads the exercises into the custom-workout sheet. User said nice-to-have for custom workouts.
2. **Continue `exerciseToMuscles()` calibration** via breakdown panel + untracked warning. Known untracked compound lifts: Thruster, Clean, Snatch, Farmers Walk, Sled Push (in `_EX_SUGGEST` but return `null` → untracked, no volume/PR credit).
3. **Home streak / "on track this week"** nudge on the client Home tab (uses `_portalRecentSessions` + `_portalScheduleDays`, already loaded).
4. **Body-tab goal lines** — target weight / body-fat % reference lines on the existing body-stat trend charts.
5. **Notifications** (low-session reminders) — the **Business tab is already built** (`renderBusinessView`: Needs Attention / Inactive 10+ / month overview / Renewals projection / Long-Term clients).
6. Longer-term SaaS direction: real per-user auth + RLS + multi-coach tenancy + white-label branding + Stripe tiers (see earlier roadmap discussion).

---

## Features Completed (latest session — library reach)

- ✅ **Client custom-workout → coach library sync** — `_logCustomPortalSession` now loads the library (the portal never runs `init()`, so the `library` global is empty there → load first or POST duplicates) then calls `_ensureLibraryHas`. Closes the documented gap.
- ✅ **Coach Library search → dataset fall-through** — searching the Library tab (`renderLibrary`, 2+ chars) now surfaces matching `free-exercise-db` exercises not already in the library, under an "Exercise Database" section with a **+ Add** button (`addLibFromDataset(id)`, links the demo via `demo_id`). Deduped by demo identity; one-shot re-render once the dataset loads (`_libDbReload` guard).

---

**Last Updated:** HEAD `9147195` — session that picked up the vanishing-supersets bug left open at the end of the prior session (needed TWO fixes to resolve it for Tim — see below), then added a "combine two existing exercises into a superset" action to the program-day editor at the user's request (see top session-log entry). Fix 1 (`cf00676`) addressed a real bug (superset-unaware drag-reorder + `removeEx()`) but didn't fix Tim's symptom; a screenshot from the user of Tim's day in the normal editor showed the real trigger — his data uses a legacy `"SS1 Name"` (no colon) tag format that every colon-requiring regex in the app silently failed on. Fix 2 (`dbf48af`) introduced a shared colon-optional `_SS_TAG_RE` and swapped it into ~30 call sites. See "Generate Next Program: supersets not surviving generation — RESOLVED" near the top of this doc for full detail. **User has not yet re-tested Tim's actual program on their phone since fix 2** — if it's still not resolved, get a fresh screenshot immediately rather than re-theorizing. **Standing instruction from the user this session:** push every fix/addition straight to `main` as it's shipped (no holding on a review branch) — they're checking along the way on their phone and will flag anything that needs reverting. **User's testing loop:** iPhone PWA, tests real client data (a client named "Tim" is the current test case for the generator), reports back with screenshots — implement, ship to main, they re-check on the phone.
